💵 1. U.S. Company Sells Software or Service

Your U.S. company makes a $100 sale.

But the U.S. company doesn’t own the product’s intellectual property (IP) or license.

Instead, it licenses it from your Irish subsidiary.

🏦 2. Royalty Payment to Irish Company

The U.S. company pays $85 to your Irish company as a royalty/license fee.

Now only $15 is taxed in the U.S.

This is legal if the licensing agreement is properly drafted (called “transfer pricing”).

🍀 3. Irish Company Sends Money to Cayman Entity

The Irish company then pays another royalty to your Cayman Islands IP-holding company, maybe $80.

This is called the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich” (optional Dutch step in-between to reduce withholding taxes).

Irish tax = low or none (due to structure or treaties).

Cayman tax = 0%.



---

🏝 4. Cayman Islands Company Holds the Profits

Now the Cayman Islands entity holds the majority of the profits tax-free.

This entity owns the IP, trademarks, and may even invest in stocks, real estate, or crypto.

You don’t personally touch the money.

🧑‍💼 5. CEO Lives Internationally – Paid in Expenses, Not Income

You are the director and CEO of the Cayman company.

The company pays your “legitimate business expenses”:

Hotel or apartment (as “business travel”)

Food (included with accommodations)

Flights (to “board meetings” or “office branches”)

Therapy or coaching (executive wellness)

Workspace, internet, devices

🌍 6. No Personal Tax Liability

You don’t draw a salary (or if you do, it’s in a 0% or territorial tax country).

You’re never in one place long enough to trigger tax residency (e.g., <183 days/year).

No income = no income tax.

Everything is company-paid = no personal expense.



---

🧾 7. Optional: Residency or Citizenship in Low-Tax Country

Obtain residency in UAE, Portugal, Georgia, or Caribbean.

Maybe even a second citizenship (Cyprus, Malta, St. Kitts, etc.).

At that point, even if you take dividends, you legally pay little or no tax.

🧠 Key Legal Concepts Behind the Magic:

Term	Meaning

Transfer Pricing	Internal pricing of services/IP between your own companies
Controlled Foreign Corp (CFC)	Rules to prevent hiding money abroad (U.S. citizens beware)
Substance Rules	Your offshore companies need to look “real” with documents & logic
Tax Residency	You only pay tax where you're legally “resident”
Territorial Tax	Only local income is taxed (not foreign) — big advantage

Also most companies have CRC rules and tax just check for appropriate country and do holding companies with real purpose to evade
